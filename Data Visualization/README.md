# Auspice Filtering and Space Complexity Plotting Code:

The notebook ```BME230A Final Project Data Visualization Notebook.ipynb``` in this directory was used to: <br>

1. ) Parse sample metadata from NCBI Datasets metadata JSONs into CSVs  usable  <br>
by the Auspice Tree viewer. Features which I wanted to filter on were <br>
strains and strain groups.<br>

2. )
 Plot size vs sample data collected from the creation of VCF matrix files<br>
and Protobuf tree files. These plots will show how greatly the sizes and <br>
space complexities of these two data types differ, although they are used<br>
for such similar purposes.<br>
