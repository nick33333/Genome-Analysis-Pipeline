# Auspice Filtering and Space Complexity Plotting Code
<br>
The notebook in this directory was used to: <br>
<br>
1.) <br>
Parse sample metadata from NCBI Datasets metadata JSONs into CSVs usable  <br>
by the Auspice Tree viewer. Features which I wanted to filter on were <br>
strains and strain groups.<br>
<br>
2.)<br>
Plot size vs sample data collected from the creation of VCF matrix files<br>
and Protobuf tree files. These plots will show how greatly the sizes and <br>
space complexities of these two data types differ, although they are used<br>
for such similar purposes.<br>
